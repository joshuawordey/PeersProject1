		PYTHON PEERS HACKATHON INSTRUCTION FILE
PROBLEM:
Agyekum is a Geography teacher at Nandom Senior High School.
He has intentions of compiling a questions and answers book
for his students. The only problem he is faced with is the fact
that he is always presented with two different files, one 
containing the questions and the other one having the answers.
So he manually transfers the answers on the answer file to the 
questions on the question file by using a copy and paste method.
He pastes the answers to each question right beneath it, hence
ending up with one file containing questions and their corresponding
answers.
Even though he is able to achieve his goal, he has a really low 
productivity curve and wishes this exercise could be automated
for him.

TO-DO:
As a python developer, you will be presented with sample questions
and answers files like the ones Agyekum works with. Your goal is to
write a program that is able to match each question with its corresponding
answer and present both questions and answers on the same file for Agyekum.

RECOMMENDED:
Not limiting your research scope, knowledge in python basics, especially
Regex and file Handling might be helpful in solving this problem.  

NOTE:
You may make a few alterations to help with your work.
But ensure that you do not alter the content of the questions
or the order in which they are arranged.
All changes made to the text files should be well documented and 
sent along the submission files.
